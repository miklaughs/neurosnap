🧠 How NeuroSnap Works
Powered by N.A.M.I.S. – Neural Adaptive Monitoring & Intervention System
NeuroSnap is a non-invasive, AI-powered neuromodulation wristband that detects early signs of seizures and intervenes using painless electrical stimulation. Designed especially for children and individuals with epilepsy, it acts before a seizure fully develops—safely and intelligently.
🔬 1. Multisensory Bio-Surveillance
NeuroSnap continuously monitors the user's body through an advanced network of sensors built into the wristband:
Sensor Type	Function
PPG (Photoplethysmography)	Tracks heart rate variability and oxygen saturation to detect nervous system shifts
3D Accelerometer + Gyroscope	"Captures tremors, convulsions, or micro-movements associated with seizure onset"
sEMG (Surface Electromyography)	"Detects abnormal electrical activity in forearm muscles, offering neuromuscular early warnings"
EDA (Electrodermal Activity)	"Monitors skin conductance linked to stress, tension, or autonomic arousal"


These sensors provide real-time data to the AI core, N.A.M.I.S., creating a constant health snapshot.
🧠 2. N.A.M.I.S. – Adaptive AI That Learns You
At the heart of NeuroSnap is N.A.M.I.S.: the Neural Adaptive Monitoring & Intervention System.
It doesn’t just detect danger. It learns the user’s unique seizure profile by studying their body’s signals over time. For example, if someone’s seizures begin with a subtle heart rate spike or a specific muscle twitch, N.A.M.I.S. will pick that up—then adapt.
N.A.M.I.S. uses deep-learning algorithms trained on large neurological datasets and personalizes its predictions by:
Recognizing early physiological changes that often happen before seizures
Adapting its thresholds based on each user’s patterns
Fusing multiple biosignals to make intelligent, real-time decisions
Whether seizures begin in the arm, legs, or deeper in the nervous system, N.A.M.I.S. picks up the early systemic warning signs — even if micro-movement shows up somewhere distant, like the legs.
⚡ 3. Smart Neuromodulation Therapy
When N.A.M.I.S. detects a high seizure risk, NeuroSnap delivers targeted electrical pulses through the wrist using skin-safe electrodes.
These pulses:
Stimulate the median and radial nerves — close to the skin — which influence the brain through afferent pathways
Help regulate abnormal brain activity by altering excitability in the central nervous system
Are gentle, safe, and non-invasive, designed to reduce seizure intensity or stop it early
Therapy can be activated automatically or manually, depending on the user’s situation.
💡 LED & Vibration Cues (User Feedback System)
Even without a screen, NeuroSnap communicates with the user through intuitive LED indicators and vibration patterns:
LED Light Cues:
Pulsing Orange Light – Active neuromodulation in progress
Solid Blue Light – Device is powered on and functioning normally
Flashing Red Light – Error or manual override required
Soft White Glow – Device is charging
Blinking Orange Circle – Manual stimulation mode activated
Vibration Feedback:
Gentle pulses confirm activation or manual press
Escalating patterns for urgent alerts or emergency status
Distinct vibration patterns accompany each light cue to reinforce understanding, especially for visually impaired users
Each visual and tactile cue corresponds to a specific system state to ensure the user is informed at all times.
🛡️ 4. Emergency Support & Data Logging
If the user becomes unresponsive, N.A.M.I.S. triggers emergency alerts to caregivers or contacts. Each episode is timestamped and securely logged for medical review. The device is also safe to use even when activated accidentally — side effects are mild and temporary, such as tingling or light warmth.

⚙️🧠 N.A.M.I.S Failsafe
This is not just an alert system. It’s an adaptive neurological shield.
🧪 MULTI-SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE STACK
Cardiovascular Data (HRV, pulse waves)
Skin Electrical Signals (EDA – Electrodermal Activity)
 Detects subtle neuro-electric stress changes even if HR is stable
Micro-motion Analysis (Absence Seizure Drift Detection)
 AI checks for:
Eye flutter patterns
Micro-falls or posture sag
Head droop or subtle zone-outs
Electromyography (EMG-lite through the wrist)
 Picks up faint neuromuscular shifts — useful in atonic seizures
Context Engine (Time, location, posture, activity level)
 If child is sitting in class, it watches for stillness when they’re normally active
🧠 SMART-ALERT LEVELS — Now with More Detail and Failover
🟢 Level 0 – Micro-Diagnostic Mode
Runs every 3 seconds in background:
Detects deviation from individual neurological signature
Uses a moving average + anomaly detection
Begins logging & enhanced scanning mode
🟠 Level 1 – Silent Pre-Intervention Mode
No alert yet — instead:
Gentle neurostimulation bursts to disrupt early wave
Internal scanning frequency increases to 0.2s
Watches if electric stability returns within 10 seconds
If stabilizes → nothing happens.
 If not → escalates.
🔵 Level 2 – User-Aware Safety Prompt
Gentle haptic sequence (e.g. 3 taps) + LED pulse
App shows: “Everything okay? Tap to confirm.”
Failsafe: If user doesn’t respond → AI continues monitoring quietly (no panic)
🟡 Level 3 – Smart Caregiver Alert
Only activates if:
No user response
AND signs of seizure increase (e.g. signal irregularities or motion gaps)
Caregiver receives:
Confidence score (e.g., “92% chance of pre-seizure detected”)
Live biometrics
“Acknowledge, False Alarm, or Trigger Help”
🔴 Level 4 – Silent Emergency Override
If no one responds AND:
Multiple signals degrade (electrical, posture, heart rhythm)
User collapses or stops moving
Then:
Sends encrypted data + GPS to emergency contact or services
Activates sustained neurostimulation loop
Logs full event for medical follow-up
🧬 BONUS: EDGE-CASE DETECTION FEATURES
⚡ Absence & Fainting Detection Module
AI is trained to detect “freezing + blink frequency shift”
Time-based stillness metrics compared to individual baseline
Head pitch angle tracking for silent collapses
Cross-referenced with electrodermal stress to detect loss of presence
🧠 Neuro-Stability Graphing
In the app, parents/doctors see:
“Stability Trendline”
Color zones: Green (stable), Yellow (watch), Red (intervention)
🔐 Summary: Why This Is Now Smarter Than Anything Out There
Feature	How It Helps
Electrical Signal Analysis	Catches seizures when HR is stable (like absence seizures)
Faint Detection AI	Identifies sudden collapses even with low movement or no tremors
Intervention Before Panic	"Tries gentle pulses before alerts, preventing false positives"
Adaptive Intelligence	"Learns over time, gets smarter with every correction"
Encrypted Emergency Mode	Never panics — quietly notifies only when all safe paths are exhausted
